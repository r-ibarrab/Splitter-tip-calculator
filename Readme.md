# Splitter Tip Calculator
This project was a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/tip-calculator-app-ugJNGbJUX)

The purpose of this project is to practice my HTML,CSS and JS skills. It is a full responsive website where you can calculate the tip of a bill of a restaurant. You choose the percentage that you are willing to pay, and it calculates the tip. It also can calculate the appropiate split of the bill specifying the number of people.

The challenge provided all the colors, images and design.
